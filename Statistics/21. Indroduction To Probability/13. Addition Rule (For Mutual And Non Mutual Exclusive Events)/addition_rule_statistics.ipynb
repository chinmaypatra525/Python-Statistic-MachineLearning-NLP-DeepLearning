    "## üîπ 1. What is the Addition Rule?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Addition Rule** in probability is used to find the probability that **at least one** of two events will occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Formula:\n",
    "For any two events A and B,\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîπ 2. Mutually Exclusive Events\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Definition:\n",
    "- Two events are **mutually exclusive** if they **cannot happen at the same time**.\n",
    "- That means:  \n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  P(A \\cap B) = 0\n",
    "  \\]\n",

    "### üî∏ Formula for Mutually Exclusive Events:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)\n",
    "\\]\n",

    "### üìå Example:\n",
    "Let‚Äôs say:\n",
    "- P(A) = probability of rolling a 1 on a die = 1/6\n",
    "- P(B) = probability of rolling a 2 on a die = 1/6\n",
    "\n",
    "These two are **mutually exclusive**, since a single die can‚Äôt show both 1 and 2 at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Output:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "P(A \\cup B) = 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3\n",
