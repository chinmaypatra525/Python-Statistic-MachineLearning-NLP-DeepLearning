    "## 🔹 1. What is the Multiplication Rule?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Multiplication Rule** is used to calculate the probability of **two events happening together**, i.e., the **intersection** of events \\( A \\) and \\( B \\):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B|A)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( P(A) \\) is the probability of event A\n",
    "- \\( P(B|A) \\) is the probability of event B **given** that A has occurred\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 2. Independent Events\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Definition:\n",
    "Two events are **independent** if the occurrence of one **does not affect** the probability of the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔸 Rule:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 Example:\n",
    "- Event A: Tossing a coin and getting heads → \\( P(A) = 0.5 \\)\n",
    "- Event B: Rolling a die and getting a 3 → \\( P(B) = \\frac{1}{6} \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since these are unrelated actions, they are independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Calculation:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "P(A \\cap B) = 0.5 \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{12} \\approx 0.083\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🔹 3. Dependent Events\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Definition:\n",
    "Two events are **dependent** if the occurrence of one **affects the probability** of the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔸 Rule:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B|A)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 Example:\n",
    "- A: Drawing an Ace from a 52-card deck → \\( P(A) = \\frac{4}{52} \\)\n",
    "- B: Drawing a King **after** the Ace is drawn, **without replacement** → \\( P(B|A) = \\frac{4}{51} \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "These events are dependent because the second draw changes based on the first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Calculation:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "P(A \\cap B) = \\frac{4}{52} \\cdot \\frac{4}{51} = \\frac{16}{2652} \\approx 0.006\n",
