    "## üîê Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, **multithreading** and **multiprocessing** are both forms of concurrent programming, allowing your program to execute multiple tasks seemingly at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Multithreading** is better for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., reading files, web scraping).\n",
    "* **Multiprocessing** is better for CPU-bound tasks (e.g., image processing, data computation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)** which makes multithreading less effective for CPU-bound operations.\n",
    "\n",

    "### What is a Thread?\n",
    "\n",
    "A thread is a lightweight, smallest unit of a process that can run concurrently. Threads share memory and resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Multithreading?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Handle I/O-bound tasks.\n",
    "* Improve responsiveness in programs (e.g., GUI apps).\n",
    "* Perform tasks concurrently without using multiple cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thread Lifecycle\n",
    "\n",
    "1. New\n",
    "2. Runnable\n",
    "3. Running\n",
    "4. Blocked/Waiting\n",
    "5. Terminated\n",
    "\n",
    "### Import Required Module\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import threading\n",

    "### Creating a Simple Thread\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "import time\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_numbers():\n",
    "    for i in range(5):\n",

    "thread = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)\n",
    "thread.start()\n",
    "thread.join()  # Wait for thread to finish\n",

    "thread.start()\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Synchronization Using Lock\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "lock = threading.Lock()\n",
    "\n",
    "def increment():\n",
    "    global counter\n",
    "    with lock:\n",

    "\n",
    "### What is a Process?\n",
    "\n",
    "A process is an independent program with its own memory space. Processes do not share memory, so communication must be done via inter-process communication (IPC).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Multiprocessing?\n",
    "\n",
    "* True parallelism using multiple cores.\n",

    "def f(n, a):\n",
    "    n.value = 3.1415\n",
